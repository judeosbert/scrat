# scrat
scrat is a new approach towards building an Open Search Engine.With increasing popularity of Google, we often forget our needs
and how we can implement search with a new logic.
If worlds best minds can come together to this open search engine, we could build something together that may forever change
how we search.
# What can you do?
Scrat initially provides you  a simple interface for the search Engine.
The developement on scrat can be followed on  a blog that will be announced later.
You can develop the scrat by cloing the sources available here and can modiy
You should also document your changes in a neat manner so that new people who would like to develop futher can understand
where scrat is now.
